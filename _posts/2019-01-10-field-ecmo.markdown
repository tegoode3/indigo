During the 10th Annual <a href="http://www.chp.edu/health-care-professionals/cme/other-cme/neonatal-pediatric-ecls-educational-conference">Neonatal and Pediatric ECMO Educational Conference</a> at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh in August, 2018, myself, other emergency medical technicians from <a href="https://www.cmuems.org/">Carnegie Mellon University EMS</a>, paramedics from the <a href="http://pittsburghpa.gov/ems/">City of Pittsburgh EMS</a>, and <a href="https://www.emergencymedicine.pitt.edu/people/leonard-weiss">Dr. Leonard Weiss</a> simulated the use of prehospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on a manikin patient to demonstrate and discuss the viability of prehospital ECMO for refractory ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. This simulation ultimately led to a poster presentation at the annual meeting of the <a href="https://naemsp.org/">National Association of EMS Physicians</a>: Leonard S. Weiss, David Palmer, Jeremiah Escajeda, Mark Pinchalk, James Dlutowski, John Mooney, Adam Palmer, Scott Studebaker, Tom Goode, and Francis X. Guyette, “Creation, Training, and Simulation of a Field Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Team”, National Association for Emergency Medical Physicians annual conference, Austin, Texas, 10 January 2019.
