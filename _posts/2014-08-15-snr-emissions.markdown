During the summers of 2012, 2013, and 2014, I interned for <a href="https://space.mit.edu/~gea/">Dr. Glenn Allen</a> at the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. Using the C-based <a href="https://space.mit.edu/asc/isis/">Interactive Spectral Interpretation System</a>, we sought to identify the physical processes responsible for gamma ray emission from Cassiopeia A, a supernova remnant roughly 11,000 light-years (3.4 kpc) from the Milky Way. Radio, X-ray, and gamma ray emission data from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory were fit to three physical models (a synchrotron emission model, an inverse Compton scattering model, and neutral pion decay model). We began development of a nonthermal bremsstrahlung model based on  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.4049">prior work</a> which suggested nonthermal bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation in the 10-32 keV energy band. In addition to model development and model fitting, I also produced graphics to visualize model fits to the three types of emissions data. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/astro-ph?searchtype=author&query=Allen%2C+G+E">Dr. Allen's publications</a> for more details.

## Visualizations

Below are three of the visualizations I produced during the project. These three graphics visualize the fits of a synchrotron emissions model, an inverse Compton scattering model, and a neutral pion decay model to radio, X-ray, and gamma ray emission data from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory.
