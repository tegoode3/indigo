Over the summer of 2016, I interned with <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~pfreeman/">Dr. Peter Freeman</a>, I explore the application of a modern time series forecasting method on ambulance demand in an urban environment. While there was existing foundation of forecasting similar types of demand (see here, here, and here), the goal of my work was to show that a newer model, (TBATS info here) could also be a suitable candidate for modeling ambulance demand using temporal data. 

We found some positive results and a description of...

## Shiny Screenshots

The slides below were presented at Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s annual undergraduate research symposium, the Meeting of the Minds, and provide an overview of the results.

## Ongoing and Future Work

I am excited to pass off the research baton to current undergraduate students who are seeking to both improve upon this existing approach and incorporate geospatial information into additional models to better support ambulance managers in their resource allocation and operational planning.
