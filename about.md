<p>I am a statistical analyst at the <a href="https://www.rand.org">RAND Corporation</a> and currently live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I use a variety of statistical and machine learning methodology to provide policymakers in homeland security and national defense with quality, objective analysis on a broad variety of topics. While earning my bachelor's and master's degrees in statistics at Carnegie Mellon University, I worked at the intersection of statistics and the fields of of prehospital medicine and emergency medical operations to advance forecasting methodology for ambulance demand in an urban environment.</p>

<p>After work, I volunteer as an emergency medical technician at the Munhall Area Prehospital Service in Homestead, Pennsylvania, and with Carnegie Mellon University Emergency Medical Service (EMS), where I also chair the agency's Board of Advisors. Even when I'm not treating patients, it is a challenge escaping EMS; the majority of my independent research, which you can see here, relates to ambulances or EMS somehow and I am the statistical reviewer for the Journal of Collegiate Emergency Medical Services. When I need a break, I enjoy creating craft cocktails with my friends; you can see some of our recent endeavours here.</p>
