<p>I am a statistical analyst at the <a href="https://www.rand.org">RAND Corporation</a> and currently live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I use a variety of statistical and machine learning <a href="https://www.rand.org/about/people/g/goode_thomas.html">methodology</a> to provide policymakers in homeland security and national defense with quality, objective analysis on a broad variety of topics. While earning my bachelor's and master's degrees in <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/msp/curriculum">statistics at Carnegie Mellon University</a>, I worked at the intersection of statistics and the fields of of prehospital medicine and emergency medical operations to advance forecasting methodology for ambulance demand in an urban environment. To see a full list of my professional skills, clearances, certifications, and past experiences, please see my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-goode/">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

<p>After work, I volunteer as an emergency medical technician at <a href="https://www.munhallems.org/">Munhall Area Prehospital Services</a> in Homestead, Pennsylvania, and with the student-run <a href="https://cmuems.org/">Carnegie Mellon University Emergency Medical Service</a>, where I also chair the agency's Board of Advisors. Even when I'm not treating patients, escaping EMS is a challenge as I review manuscripts as the statistical reviewer for the <a href="https://www.collegeems.com/">Journal of Collegiate Emergency Medical Services</a> and the majority of my independent research, which you can see <a href="http://tomgoode.com/projects/">here</a>, relates to ambulances or EMS operations. In the evenings, I enjoy exploring the world of amateur radios and creating craft cocktails with my friends; you can see some of our recent endeavours and recipies on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cocktailarsenal/">Instagram page</a>.</p>
