<p>I am a statistical analyst at the <a href="https://www.rand.org">RAND Corporation</a> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I use a variety of statistical and machine learning <a href="https://www.rand.org/about/people/g/goode_thomas.html">methods</a> to provide policymakers with quality, objective analysis on a broad variety of homeland security and national security topics. While earning my bachelor's and master's degrees in <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/msp/curriculum">statistics at Carnegie Mellon University</a>, I conducted research at the intersection of statistics, prehospital medicine, and emergency medical operations; this includes work to improve forecasting methodology for ambulance demand in urban environments, visualize cardiac arrest treatment data, and explore the impact of continuing education on patient care. See my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-goode/">LinkedIn profile</a> for a full list of my professional skills, certifications, and past experiences.</p>

<p>On the weekends, I work as an emergency medical technician on an ambulance at <a href="https://www.munhallems.org/">Munhall Area Prehospital Services</a> in Homestead, Pennsylvania, and volunteer with the student-run <a href="https://cmuems.org/">Carnegie Mellon University Emergency Medical Service</a>, where I served in numerous leadership roles as a student and currently chair the agency's Board of Advisors. Even when I'm not treating patients, escaping EMS is a challenge; I am the statistical reviewer for the <a href="https://www.collegeems.com/">Journal of Collegiate Emergency Medical Services</a> and the majority of my independent research, which you can see <a href="http://tomgoode.com/projects/">here</a>, relates to prehospital care or EMS operations.</p>
    
<p>In the evenings, I enjoy exploring the world of amateur radio (KC3NFW), losing online chess games, and creating craft cocktails with friends.</p>
